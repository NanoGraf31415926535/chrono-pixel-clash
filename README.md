# Pixel Shooter: An Early Access Adventure
Welcome to Pixel Shooter, a work-in-progress pixel art game developed with pure HTML and JavaScript! This project is a passion endeavor, and I'm excited to share its early stages with you.

## About the Game
Pixel Shooter is designed to be a fast-paced, engaging pixel-art shooter. This initial release focuses on establishing the fundamental game flow and core mechanics. While it's still under active development, you can get a feel for the direction the game is heading.

## Current Features (Early Access)
- Pure HTML & JavaScript: Built from the ground up using standard web technologies.
- Approximate Game Flow: Experience the basic loop of gameplay, movement, and shooting.
- Pixel Art Style: Enjoy a charming retro aesthetic.

## How to Play
To run the game:

`Clone or Download: Get the game files from the repository (if applicable) or download the provided HTML and JavaScript files.`

### Option 1: Open `index.html` Directly (Simplest)

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. No special setup or server is usually required for basic functionality.

### Option 2: Using a Simple Python Server (Recommended for local development)

If you encounter issues with direct opening (e.g., related to file paths or browser security), you can use a simple Python server to serve the files.

Prerequisite: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Navigate to the Game Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your index.html and other game files are located.

`cd path/to/your/game/folder`


Start the Server: Run one of the following commands:

Python 3:

`python -m http.server`


Python 2 (if you still use it):

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`


Access the Game: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 (or the port indicated by your terminal).

## Future Plans
I am actively developing this game and plan to release weekly updates! Future updates will include:

- New levels and environments.

- More enemy types and boss battles.

- Player upgrades and power-ups.

- Improved sound effects and music.

- Refined gameplay mechanics and controls.

- Bug fixes and performance optimizations.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
